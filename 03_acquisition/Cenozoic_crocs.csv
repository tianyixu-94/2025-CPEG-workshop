This is then followed by 166 m with repetitive coarsening upward rhythms, and then 20 m of lacustrine shales. The formation is topped by interbedded sands and shales with a thickness of 104 m. In natural exposures, the much thinner 40 m development of the formation is developed as a dominantly dark claystone, with well-defined, mainly laterally continuous, thin ferruginous coarse sandstone beds.

ETE event: ., ETE env comment: shallow-water floodplain\r\n\r\nLukaye et al. 2016: The bulk of the Kakara Formation’s exposed section was deposited on a coastal plain, with the intermittent coarse ferruginous sandstones introduced by crevasse splay from nearby channels; these channels are represented by the sandstone development of the new road-cut exposure. Increasing nearshore lacustrine interbeds in the upper parts of the formation were however noted by Roller et al. [9]. The thick Turaco section suggests a development which introduced coarse deltaic clastics into the basin. Palynofacies associations suggest a shift from more open lacustrine to nearshore environments about 200 m above formational base [14] or the development of humid fan delta/mouth bar deposits throughout [13].\r\n","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","ETE Abrasion: ., ETE Assemblage formation: attritional, ETE transport: ., ETE weathering/trampling: ., ETE part concentration: ., ETE time represented: . ,ETE vert pres: ., ETE invert pres: ., ETE plant pres: .","general faunal/floral","bulk","","","2 specimens","","","","ETE Size: macro; ETE reference list: 926, ; ETE museum list: ","","paleobotany,vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

Within these beds, some last thin clay layers preserve dessication marks. This matrix is often superficially altered and friable, more compact in-depth.

Throughout this ensemble, and particularly in the fossiliferous levels, cross-bedded stratifications abound. At the base, the series rests by soft layers (clays?) on an ensemble where compact sandstones dominate in thick banks.

Late Burdigalian, N7/NN4.\r\n\r\nBialkowski et al. 2006: The Tertiary series unconformably lays over the Early Creta- ceous substratum (marls and limestones alternations, marly sediments). They are composed of lagoonal to marine facies with some intercalations of continental deposits (Fig. 2a). The Châteauredon 1 micromammal site (CR1) has been discovered in a lignitic interval interbedded within grey marls and lacustrine carbonates (Lalaï, 1986). This site is placed on the composite section at 360 m by field correlation. Laterally and a few hundred of meters away from this site, some marine deposits contain benthic foraminifera that give an Aquitanian/Early Langhian age (Anglada in Lalaï, 1986). This micro-mammal fossil site is attributed to MN4 (Aguilar et al., 1999, 1996), a micromammal zone that covers the late Burdigalian/ Early Langhian interval. The occurrence of Avicennia pollen in this dark layer (Châteauneuf et al., in press; Jimenez- Moreno, 2005), gives an age range similar to that deduced from the micomammal fauna (Bessedik et Cabrera, 1985).  The Châteauredon 1 site (MN4) corresponds to a mammal zone whose stratigraphic attribution is largely variable. According to the authors its extension varies between 16.5 to 17.5 Ma (Kempf et al., 1997) and 15.8 to 16.6 Ma (Agusti et al., 2001). The beginning of the zone is placed at 17.6 Ma by Aguilar and collaborators (2003).

More recently, the Etadunna Formation has been proposed to be 26.1-23.6 Ma old based on a best-fit age-model of magnetostratigraphic data. The Pinpa Local Fauna is the oldest of the three distinct faunal units recovered from stratigraphic levels in the Namba Formation, and has been correlated with the oldest faunal zone (Zone A) of the Etadunna Formation, which has been dated as 25.3-24.9 Ma old (chrons 7An and 7Ar) based on magnetostratigraphy.

(2019) date the Talisma sediments of the Solimoes Formation as 10.89 Ma.\r\n\r\nLatrubesse et al. (2007) suggested a Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation. The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

Biswas (1992) considered the Naredi Formation to range from late Paleocene to early Eocene in age. While this age estimate may be reasonable at the type section of the formation (where there is neither lignite nor fossil cetaceans), it appears that this is not the case at Panandhro and Akri Lignite Mines. Here, the stratigraphy is more complex and the beds yielding the whales are best included in the Panandhro Formation of Saraswati and Banerjee (1984, preferred here) or the Lakhpat Formation of Mukhopadhyay and Shome (1996). These beds are equivalent in age to the Harudi Formation: middle/late Lutetian. The Domanda Formation of central Pakistan is also Lutetian in age (Gingerich et al., 2001a).\r\n\r\nSaraswati et al. 2014: The present study refers the fossil-bearing strata of Panandhro to planktic zone P12-P13 and the Bartonian Stage. This validates the strontium stratigraphy within the limit of the analytical error. Some of the estimated ages (see Table 1; Ravikant and Bajpai, 2010) are close to the base of the Bartonian (41.2 Ma as per Gradstein et al., 2012). Therefore, the age of the Panandhro fauna is indisputably Bartonian and more so when the authors report them to have been washed down from the overlying beds.","","""shale""","","poorly lithified","silty","Y","","","","","","mire/swamp","","Locality is a pit within the Panandhro lignite mines.","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","good","","","","","","common","","","","","","taxonomic","surface (float),mechanical,field collection","","all macrofossils","99","","","","","","vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

The ‘‘Eudinoceras’’ in Granger’s sketch were de- scribed as Gobiatherium mirificum (Osborn and Granger, 1932). This species is the dominant taxon in terms of abundance at this site (appendix 3), and it is regarded as one of the index taxa for the Arshantan (Lucas, 2001). We think that the bed that contains Gobiatherium mirificum (‘‘Eudinoceras’’) in Granger’s section is roughly correlative with the beds that yielded Litolophus, Gobiatherium, and Metacoryphodon within the middle beds of the NHA sequence.

Its age assigment has slightly changed several times over the past decades. Currently it is regarded as belonging to the OSM unit C (i.e. sedimentary cycle OSM 3), corresponding to the lower part of the Middle Miocene. Studies on several mammal groups have revealed that the locality biochronologically now is unequivocally referrable to the deeper part of MN 5 and not, as earlier thought, to MN6. The absolute age of the locality is about 16 Ma (see Fahlbusch, 2003 and references therein).\r\nThe fossiliferous bed itself is subdivided into 6 (sub)layers (A to F from base to top). However, in almost all cases no particular horizon is specified for a particular fossil or taxon in the paleontological literature.","The base of the fossiliferous bed rests on a paleorelief of about 30 cm.\r\nThe (sub)layers A to D are composed of greenish-gray to brownish-black, marly conglomerates (""Geröllmergel"") with decrease in quantity and size of pebbles from max. 10 cm in the lower part to few mm in the upper part of the fossiliferous bed. (Sub)layer A is partially well cemented by carbonate minerals. The pebbles mainly consist of quartz but also of various crystalline rock and hornfels, and some are flattened limestone pebbles.

Its age assigment has slightly changed several times over the past decades. Currently it is regarded as belonging to the OSM unit C (i.e. sedimentary cycle OSM 3), corresponding to the lower part of the Middle Miocene. Studies on several mammal groups have revealed that the locality biochronologically now is unequivocally referrable to the deeper part of MN 5 and not, as earlier thought, to MN6. The absolute age of the locality is about 16 Ma (see Fahlbusch, 2003 and references therein).\r\nThe fossiliferous bed itself is subdivided into 6 (sub)layers (A to F from base to top).

(Sub)layer A is partially well cemented by carbonate minerals. The pebbles mainly consist of quartz but also of various crystalline rock and hornfels, and some are flattened limestone pebbles.

The age of the Trinil Haupt Knochenschicht Faunal Unit is considered latest Early Pleistocene."" (Delfino & De Vos 2010)\r\n""This study constructs a chronostratigraphic framework for the Trinil site by documenting new stratigraphic sections and test pits, and by applying 40Ar/39Ar, paleomagnetic, and luminescence (pIRIR290) dating methods. Our study identifies two distinct, highly fossiliferous channel fills at the Trinil site. The stratigraphically lower Bone-Bearing Channel 1 (BBC-1) dates to 830–773 ka, while Bone-Bearing Channel 2 (BBC-2) is substantially younger with a maximum age of 450 ± 110 ka and an inferred minimum age of 430 ± 50 ka. Furthermore, significantly younger T2 terrace deposits are present at similar low elevations as BBC-1 and BBC-2.

(Delfino & De Vos 2010)\r\n""This study constructs a chronostratigraphic framework for the Trinil site by documenting new stratigraphic sections and test pits, and by applying 40Ar/39Ar, paleomagnetic, and luminescence (pIRIR290) dating methods. Our study identifies two distinct, highly fossiliferous channel fills at the Trinil site. The stratigraphically lower Bone-Bearing Channel 1 (BBC-1) dates to 830–773 ka, while Bone-Bearing Channel 2 (BBC-2) is substantially younger with a maximum age of 450 ± 110 ka and an inferred minimum age of 430 ± 50 ka. Furthermore, significantly younger T2 terrace deposits are present at similar low elevations as BBC-1 and BBC-2.

Jack Williams Jr., who lived in the township of Eungella, approximately 70 km west of Mackay, collected rocks and fossils throughout the Pioneer Valley and surrounding region.

Earth Sci. 47).","Mackness et al. (2000) briefly describe the fossiliferous sequence within the Allingham Fm. as clays silts, sands and calcareous sands. This sequence is overlain by a nodular limestone called the Chara Limestone which in turn is overlain by basalt. Below the erosive ase of the Allingham Fm. a lateritic horizon occurs in which channels are cut down filled with basalt pebble-bearing deposits. This implies that the Allingham Fm. in its entirety is coeval with the basaltic volcanism in that area and that basalt flows probably dammed streams and thus created the conditions under which the Allingham Fm. was deposited. The basalt flows including the Allingham Fm. are referred to as Nulla Basalt Province the oldest rocks of which are dated as 5.2 Ma.

Henningsen (1965) defines this formation as a series of tuffaceous sandstones with intercalations of conglomerates, siltstones and occasionally shales, dark green and brownish green when altered. Mora (1979), describes two subunits according to their sedimentological characteris- tics: The subunit of volcaniclastic conglomerates of gray-green color, overlain by shales that settled in a transitional environ- ment between delta and beach. The subunit of black shales, interspersed with strata of sandstones and fine conglomerates, was deposited in a paralic environment of estuary or swamp type. They are very chloritized and basically consist of subvolcanic products.\r\nThe paleontological material recovered is housed at the Geology Section of the Natural History Department at The National Museum of Costa Rica, and comes from a level of fine conglomerate that is located towards the roof of a sequence of blue clays, which in turn is overlain by a sequence of medium to fine sandstones, which confirms its association with the superior subunit or subunit of shales (sensu Mora, 1979). Granados and Aguilar (1983), based on the presence of molluscs, obtained a Middle-Late Miocene age for the Curré Formation.\r\n\r\n","Subaquatic fan delta: The lithofacies of conglomerates is what characterizes this depositional environment and is composed of blue clay intraclasts, coming from the lower level which it overlies at an erosional discordance. The clasts have diameters that vary between 5 and 13 cm; they are well rounded, little or not spherical; some have point contact, but 90% of them float in a matrix of glauconitic clay. The clasts are arranged with their long axis parallel to the layer of stratification, and it is possible to observe some degree of imbrication. In this sequence are frequent bone and dental remains of various vertebrates, both terrestrial and marine. The Trypanites ichnofacies, in this case, is inferred indirectly from the blue clay intraclasts that are usually perforated by bivalves of the family Pholadidae, from which it is still possible to find remains of the valves within the fossil traces of Gastrochaenolites sp.","conglomerate","","","","","","","","","","deltaic indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","","","vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

Miocene, Santacrucian age assigned. But:\r\n\r\nIn preliminary studies, the Aisol Formation was considered early Miocene (probably Santacrucian SALMA; e.g., Groeber 1951; Dessanti 1954, 1956; González Díaz 1972; Núñez 1976) based upon few fossil findings and stratigraphic correlations. Nonetheless, it is also worth mentioning that in one of those preliminary studies, Groeber (1952) suggested that the unit (informally called «Estratos Calchaquíes» by then) was late Miocene, and was included among the «Arauco-Entrerriano» levels. Later studies did not further the debate. Pascual and Odreman-Rivas (1973; see also Pascual and De la Fuente 1993) placed the Aisol Formation in the Miocene, in the temporal interval between the Santacrucian and Friasian SALMAs. It was after the analysis of new fossil findings that Soria (1983) specifically allocated the Aisol Formation to the Friasian s.l. (including Colloncuran, Friasian s.s., and Mayoan, following Bondesio et al. 1980), because of the occurrence of post-Santacrucian and pre- Chasicoan mammals. This hypothesis was also followed by later authors (Sepúlveda et al. 2001, 2007). The analysis of the new fossil material and the strati- graphic control of the findings led to recognize two dif- ferent fosiliferous sections in the profile, with faunal as- semblages of different ages. The LS is probably middle Miocene, as Soria suggested (1983), perhaps Friasian s.s. (older than 15 Ma; Marshall and Salinas 1990) or Colloncuran (15.5-14 Ma; Marshall et al. 1977; Marshall and Salinas 1990), following the Patagonian scheme. Unfor- tunately, there is no consensus about the time span cov- ered by some of the SALMAs, including the Friasian one. Specific studies on age and taxonomic composition are needed before making any comparisons with more distantly located stratigraphic units.\r\nThree different sections are recognized within the Aisol Formation, with fossil vertebrates in the lower (LS) and middle (MS) sections. According to preliminary results of Forasiepi et al., 2011: Lower Section: Friasian s.s (not used anymore). or Colloncuran and Middle Section: Huayquerian.\r\n","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","","biostratigraphic","","MACN,MLP","","","","Soria; Gonzales Díaz, E.

The species cited by Filhol (1877, Ann. Sci. Geol. 8, p. 212) as ""<i>Cainotherium commune</i>, E.

(2021). The first appearance datum for Caviomorpha in South America is purported to be the CTA-27 site in the Contamana region of Perú, which is hypothesized to be ∼41 Ma (Middle Eocene) in age. However, the presence of the same caviomorph species and/or genera at both CTA-27 and at Santa Rosa is now difficult to reconcile with a >11-My age difference. To further test the Middle Eocene age estimate for CTA-27, we ran multiple Bayesian tip-dating analyses of Caviomorpha, treating the ages of all Paleogene species from Perú as unknown. These analyses produced mean age estimates for Santa Rosa that closely approximate the maximum 29.6 ± 0.08 Ma composite date provided by detrital zircons, but predict that CTA-27 is much younger than currently thought (∼30 Ma). We conclude that the ∼41 Ma age proposed for CTA-27 is incorrect, and that there are currently no compelling Eocene records of either rodents or primates in the known fossil record of South America.","30-cm-thick lens of light-grey clay with irregular limestone concretions at the top of the Yahuarango Formation","claystone","","lithified","muddy","Y","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","mesofossils,microfossils","none","","teeth","","","","","body,original phosphate","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","field collection","","all microfossils","","","","","Museum repository: Museum of Natural Hisotory in Lima, Peru","","","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

They did not name the site. Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) named the new genus and species _Antarctodolops dailyi_ on the basis of the same specimens and called the site RV-8200. Both abbreviations refer to the University of California at Riverside. According to Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984), the collection was made in the summer of 1982.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Marenssi et al. (1994), scientists of the Departamento Científico de Paleontología de Vertebrados of the Museo de La Plata (DPV-MLP) and of the Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) collected fossils on Seymour Island starting in the 1980s. In addition to several new sites, they collected additional specimens at the UCR site, now called DPV 6/84. They mention (p. 5) that American authors also call this site ""IPS locality 445"", the ""Rocket Site"", or the ""Mammal Site"".\r\n\r\nDPV 6/84 is located on the southern side of a canyon unofficially named ""Breakwind Canyon"". Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) give the coordinates as 64°13'S, 56°40'W, but these coordinates appear to be in the sea northwest of the island. Maps showing the location of DPV 6/84 were published by several authors, including Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984, fig. 1), Cione and Reguero (1994: fig. 2), Marenssi et al. (1994, fig. 2), Goin et al. (1999, fig. 1), and Chornogubsky et al.

The age model for the La Meseta Formation (and recently-defined Submeseta Formation) is controversial. Strontium isotopes (Ivany et al., 2008) suggest earlier ages, with the La Meseta (Telm1-Telm5) almost entirely Ypresian and the Submeseta (Telm6-Telm7) Middle-Late Eocene. Montes et al. (2013) also created an age model incorporating magnetostratigraphy to support the largely-Ypresian age for the La Meseta and Middle-Late Eocene for the Submeseta. Some mammals are similar to the radiometrically-constrained late early Eocene Paso del Sapo assemblage of Patagonia (Gelfo et al., 2009, Tejedor et al., 2009), but the mammals are not exactly similar (Bond et al., 2011). However, Douglas et al. (2014) re-evaluated the strontium data and used dinoflagellate biostratigraphy to argue for a Lutetian (Telm2-4) and younger (Bartonian to mid-Priabonian for Telm5-6) age range. Amenábar et al. (2019) also found younger ages from dinoflagellates: Lutetian (Telm1-mid Telm 3), Bartonian (mid Telm 3-mid Telm 5), and Priabonian (upper Telm 5), SPDZ10-SPDZ13. This age range is more consistent with the presence of basilosaurid whales in Telm4 and Telm7, as basilosaurids are globally-distributed first in the middle Eocene (Buono et al., 2016). Although the ages are still debated, the dinoflagellate age model of Amenábar et al. (2019) is used here.","Finely laminated beds of silty sandstone, some of which are interbedded with pebbly conglomeratic units interpreted to represent shell banks. The finer-grained beds between the shell banks are finely laminated, and exhibit ripple marks and flaser bedding. Vertical and oblique burrows are common throughout the finer-grained units. Small to large cut-and-fill channel features occur within the sandy siltstone facies. Prominent slump structures and lenses of gravel are associated with these channels. The shell banks consist of individual beds that range in thickness from .5 to 2m, and extend laterally as much as 1km. The banks are characterized by coarse- to fine-grained, well-sorted arkosic sandstone beds that contain pebble- to cobble-sized clasts. Most of the shell banks are extremely fossiliferous.

A study by Wiedman and Feldmann (1988) on the ichnofossil fauna and depositional environment of the La Meseta Formation concluded that the Telm5 setting was a littoral to very shallow sublittoral clastic marine terrain, definitely above storm base and most probably above normal wave base. They agreed with Elliot and Trautrnan (1982) that Units II and III probably represent a tidally dominated environment, but evidence from sedimentary structures is also consistent with a barrier bar model and does not represent a shallowing upward sequence. Elliot and Trautman (1982) favored a deltaic model. The analysis of trace fossils and body fossils (including vertebrate remains and large, abundant wood fragments) indicates variable nearshore, shallow-marine environments. A scenario for the depositional environment could include a combination ebb-tidal (or possibly flood-tidal) delta-barrier island complex (Stilwell & Zinsmeister, 1992).","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","allochthonous","time-averaged","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","sieve,field collection","","some macrofossils","","","IAA, DPV/MLP","1982-1990s","Repository: University of California, Riverside","","marine invertebrate,vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

Based on K/Ar dating of underlying tuff layers, the AGL vertebrate level is considered younger than 7.93 Ma (about 7.5–7.0 Ma) (de Muizon and DeVries, 1985; de Muizon and Bellon, 1986; Lambert and de Muizon, 2013).

This suggests the Peligran SALMA might be early Selandian in age. \r\n\r\nAccording to Andreis et al. (1975), the upper sectionof Salamanca Formation (= Hansen Member) in the San Jorge Gulf area was accumulated under infra-littoral and transitional sea conditions. The sediments were accumulated in low energy environments yielded by submarine bars or littoral banks that had reduced the circulation in a sea with little differences between high and low tides. Based on foraminifera, Bertels (1975) assigned the upper levels of the Salamanca Formation to the Upper Danian. This hypothesis was supported by the 40K/40A isotopic age of 61 ± 5Ma obtained from a vitreous tuff belonging to the Hansen Member at the Ca˜nad´on Hondo locality (Andreis 1977; Marshall et al. 1981). This age was subsequently corrected to 62.6 ± 5Ma byMarshall (1982). Additionally, two more reliable radiometric ages sampled by Marshall et al. (1981) in two basaltic units at or just under the base of the Salamanca Formation yielded ages of 64.0 ± 0.8Ma and 62.8 ± 0.8 Ma. Marshall et al. (1981, 1997) used these ages and palaeo-magnetic data to refer the overlaying BNI to polarity subchron C26r (= Danian Stage).

(2019) date the Talisma sediments of the Solimoes Formation as 10.89 Ma.\r\n\r\nLatrubesse et al. (2007) suggested a Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation. The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

The land-mammal assemblage from locality 3278 contains the insectivore Crypholestes?, a genus apparently endemic to\r\nsouthern California and only confidently identifed from strata of early Uintan ""Age"" (middle Eocene) (Novacek, 1976).

In terms of correlation with the standard European section, Givens (1974), Givens and Kennedy (1979), Saul (1983), and Squires (1984, 1987) considered the middle Eocene ""Transition Stage"" to be correlative with the middle part of the Lutetian Stage. \r\n","Fine to medium sandstone, gray, fossiliferous, with basal cobble conglomerate.

(2019) date the Talisma sediments of the Solimoes Formation as 10.89 Ma.\r\n\r\nLatrubesse et al. (2007) suggested a Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation. The snake material we studied was collected at the Talisma  locality, which is considered by some authors as belonging to the Huayquerian- Montehermosan (Late Miocene/Pliocene) because of the presence of the rodents Potamarchus murinus and Neopliblema horridula (Santos et al., 1993; Negri, 2004). According to Santos and Negri (1993), the faunal set of xenarthrans (Tardigrada) suggests, on one hand, a probable affinity with the fauna of the Santacrucian Age of Argentina (Early-Middle Miocene) and, on the other, a relation with the Laventan Age of Colombia (Middle Miocene). According to Negri (2004; unpubl. data), the faunistic association of Tardigrada in this locality would indicate an older age, correlatable and close to the Laventan (13.5–11.8 Ma, Madden et al., 1997). Here, we follow the arguments of Latrubesse et al. (2007) and assume a probable Late Miocene age for the Solimo es Formation."" (Hsiou and Albino, 2009:613)\r\n\r\nCozzuol 2006: The diachronic nature of the Mesopotamian assemblage was rejected by Cozzuol (1993) and, more recently and with more complete data, by Cione et al. (2000). Surprisingly, several authors still insist on the ‘mixed’ nature of the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (Linares, 2004; Zucol et al., 2005). All specimens from the Mesopotamian come from the base of the Ituzaingo´ Formation and concentrate in discontinuous lenticular levels (probably channel filling) known as the ‘Conglomerado osı´fero’ (i.e. bone-bearing conglomerate), which lies on the marine Parana´ Formation with an erosional unconformity between them. Cione et al. (2000) show that there is no basis for considering the Mesopotamian mammals Montehermosan. The Mesopotamian shares with the Chasicoan 18 first generic occurrences (plus 2 more with doubts) and 28 (plus another possible 4) first generic occurrences with the typical Huayquerian. With the constraints imposed by the underlying Parana´ Formation, the upper section of which was dated by several biostratigraphic studies as early Late Miocene (early Tortonian), this information places the Mesopotamian associ- ation well in the Huayquerian SALMA time interval (9.0– 6.8 Ma, Flynn and Swisher, 1995). As shown subsequently, the affinities between the Acre assemblage and the Mesopotamian are very large.\r\n\r\nSantos et al 1993: :Idade Huayqueriense-Montehermosense, Mioceno superior-Plioceno do sudoeste do Estado do Amazonas, Brasil.","dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably diagenetic.\r\n\r\n""The section is dominated by fine sediments, mainly silts and clays, with gypsum and calcite veins in the lower part and manganese stains in the upper part, both probably digenetic.

It was previously dated by pollen analysis, mammal stratigraphy, and an unpublished radiometric K/Ar analysis as late Paleocene (see Kedves & Russell 1982). However, several lines of more recent evidence indicate an older, middle Paleocene (Selandian) age, of about 60-61 Ma. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that the eruption took place during a reversed interval (Kedves & Russell 1982). Fossils of the mammal Plesiadapis from Menat enable the locality to be connected to the biostratigraphic framework established in the Western Interior USA that relies extensively on this genus (Gingerich 1976; Secord et al. 2006). The abundance of the genus, its rapid evolution, and its Holarctic dispersal history allow species of Plesiadapis to play an important role in the zonation of Paleocene continental sediments and in correlation of faunas on both sides of the North Atlantic (e.g., Gingerich 1976). Two remarkable skeletons of P. insignis, one of them nearly complete, have been found in lake deposits at Menat, and this species closely compares to P. praecursor / P. anceps in North America (pers. comm. P. Gingerich August 2008). This suggests an early Selandian age, equivalent to the early Tiffanian Ti-1/Ti-2 land mammal biozonation sensu Secord et al. (2006) (see also Gingerich 1976; Russell 1967, 1975). In North America, the Ti1 and Ti2 biozones occur within magnetic polarity Chron 26r (Secord et al. 2006), consistent with the reversed polarity of the Menat sediments.","spongo-diatomitic","diatomite","","","","","","","","","","crater lake","volcanic basin","Volcanic Paleolake (maar) deposit","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","mold/impression","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","field collection,survey of museum collection","MNHN","","","","Piton","","","","paleoentomology","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

In the upper part, marls, calcarenites and bioclastic limestones with a rich foraminiferal fauna are predominant; locally, layers of polygenic conglomerates are present. Furthermore, several levels of calcarenite rich in gastropods (cerithids) and other marine invertebrates are present in the medium-basal portion of the sequence.

The vertebrate site is represented by a small exposure of lacustrine clay in a road cut near the village of Oschiri (De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974). The age of the mammal assemblage of Oschiri has been discussed by several authors (e.g. De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974; Azzaroli and Guazzone, 1979; Azzaroli, 1983; Van der Made, 2008). The micromammals are quite diverse, with nine taxa including seven endemic species (De Bruijn and Rümke, 1974). The advanced endemism of Ctenodactylidae and the presence of Gliridae, Talpidae and Soricidae are very similar to the mainland taxa, and suggest different phases of colonization of the Corsica Sardinia Massif (Ferrandini et al., 2000; Mennecart et al., 2017, 2019). The Oligo-Miocene palaeogeographical context of the western Mediterranean indicates that the latest additions to the insular association arrived in Sardinia during the European Land Mammal Unit MN3, which is coincident with the early Burdigalian marine regression, around 20 Ma ago (Van der Made, 2008; Zoboli and Pillola, 2017b).","""lignitic clay deposit""","claystone","","","","","lignite","","","","","fluvial-lacustrine indet.","rift","The Oschiri locality belongs to the Oligocene-Miocene Sardinia rift graben which is connected to the decoupling of the Sardinia-Corsica block from the southern margin of Europe (see, e.g. Carminati et al., 2012, pp. 434-473 in Roberts & Bally (eds.))","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","","","vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

With the geochronological evidence now available from Santa Rosa, and the biochronological evidence for a close correlation of the Shapaja and Santa Rosa sections, we propose that a more parsimonious explanation for the occurrence of otherwise Deseadan taxa in the Shapaja localities is that those localities are, in fact, Deseadan in age. Given such an age estimate, we suggest that the two positive δ13C excursions identified in the Shapaja chemostratigraphies would be better correlated with those that occur at ∼26.5 and ∼25.5 Ma in the generalized global record (ref. 28, their figure 28.11).","Yellow-greenish microconglomerate with gypsum and plant remains. ","conglomerate","","","","Y","","","","","","fluvial-deltaic indet.","","from Antoine et al. 2021: a marine/brackish influence can be hypothesized in the middle part of the section (between TAR-20 and TAR-22) thanks to the conspicuous presence of myliobatid and pristid selachians (bat rays and sawfish, respectively). These taxa co-occur with a freshwater ichthyo- fauna dominated by characiform actinopterygians and dipnoans, thus pointing to an estuarine environment. The presence of neonate/young batoid specimens at TAR-20, TAR-13, and TAR-72 might further support brackish conditions for the concerned interval, as many Myliobatis females enter estuaries and coastal plains to give birth today (Mianzan et al., 2001). Accordingly, we can hypothesize that the concerned set- tings were close to such protected environments playing a nursery role for bat rays (even if the occurrence of a minute euryhaline/freshwater myliobatid species of unknown affinities cannot be fully discarded).","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","field collection","","","","","","2014","","","vertebrate","marine","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","hydroxyapatite","","",""
